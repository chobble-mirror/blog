For the last decade or so I have pledged to donate at least 10% of my income to charitable causes, and my work as a freelancer will be no different.

As 'Chobble' that 10% will go to the [Against Malaria Foundation](https://www.againstmalaria.com) who represent one of the best value for money ways of saving lives - they buy insecticide-treated nets for people to sleep under, with an average cost of just $5,500 per life saved.

(You can search for me - Stefan Burke - on [their list of sponsors](https://www.againstmalaria.com/Donations.aspx) to see my previous donations)

I am not sharing this to brag - plenty of people donate much more than me or work in harder jobs than mine, on the front lines of care.

But my dad often told me - and studies agree - that you should not be shy about your donations to good causes. Being vocal encourages others to chip in.

So if you can spare a percentage of your income, please consider donating it to [an effective charity](https://www.givewell.org/)!
