In my previous roles my knowledge about how to optimise websites to do well on Google has been something that customers / bosses have really appreciated.

I much prefer the "teach a man to fish" approach to online marketing - it's much more satisfying to educate people about how to optimise their sites than it is to do the work myself, and it also avoids the tricky problem of working with two clients who compete against each other, which always feels gross.

So! I've started **[a Patreon page at patreon.com/Chobble][patreon]** to share this advice, host Q&As and live streams, and field questions. It costs £20 per month for full access, which feels like good value to me.

"Search engine optimisation" often gets a bad rep, because the industry is full of people taking spammy shortcuts, and search engine results often end up full of low-content pages jostling for the top spot.

But it doesn't have to be that way!

There are ways to rank well which don't involve anything spammy or gross. Instead, we can focus on high quality content which addresses the needs of users, performant and clear pages that direct visitors to the information they need, and organic networking and link-building across websites that make contextual sense.

Those are the kind of tips I'll be sharing in the group - simple, practical things you can do to make your site more enticing to potential customers.

You don't need any specific technical skills, just the ability to edit your website and the ability to set some time aside to do it.
