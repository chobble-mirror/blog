Like all Brits my main source of nutrition is our national dish - baked beans.

But the sad reality is that many of my countryfolk are eating substandard beans that have been mis-cooked.

This post explains how to cook your baked beans perfectly.

**tl;dr - Branston, eight minutes, microwave, lid.**

Firstly, they **must** be [Branston beans](https://branstonbeans.co.uk/) - no others compare. If you really can't find Branston anywhere then Morrisons own-brand ones will do, but **do not fall for the Heinz propaganda** - they're taking you for a fool, trading off their once-good name to sell sad little pebbles barely even worthy of being called beans. Sickening.

Secondly, you need to **microwave the beans for eight minutes**, with something covering the top of your microwavable vessel to keep the moisture in. I recommend cooking in a Pyrex jug with a silicone lid.

Now at this point you're probably screaming _"but the tins say 3 minutes!"_ at your screen. But the tins are wrong - that's nowhere near enough. I don't know why Branston put this inaccurate information on their product but I guess they figure all the other bean tins says three minutes and it's a competitive market, or it's because three minutes means the beans will be _"done"_ at the same time as your toast, or something.

Three minutes just _heats_ the beans - booooring! At eight minutes the beans get softer and the sauce gets thicker. The full, glorious potential of the tin is achieved.

Actor Steve Coogan - who I once thought was quite clever - was on the Off-Menu podcast ([Episode 211](https://www.offmenupodcast.co.uk/transcripts)) where he made it clear that he doesn't microwave his beans for long enough. To quote:

> _"When you microwave beans, they come out hot and hard. Hot, mini bullets in, sort of, watery tomato sauce. What you need to do is-, when you're doing a breakfast, the first thing you put on is the beans and really let them break down. It's almost like-, almost to the level of mushy peas but not quite. So they're sort of mushy beans. Then they're much nicer to put on your breakfast. So don't-, anyone who puts beans in the microwave I think is-, I know they're probably-, maybe they're busy and they probably don't like people saying that but I just think it's about quality of life at the end of the day."_

You're right about the beans being better when they break down, Steve, but you **can** achieve that in the microwave - it just takes **eight minutes**!

You might be tempted to follow Steve Coogan's advice about cooking beans in a pan for a long time, but here are the reasons that eight minutes in the microwave is better:

- **You don't have to stir.** Try cooking beans in a saucepan for ages without stirring! Some will get stuck to the pan. That's wasted beans!

- **There's less mess.** No sauce splatters out because you've put a cover on, and you don't have to get a wooden spoon dirty.

- **It's faster.** The microwave starts cooking your beans immediately, but with a saucepan it takes a while to get going.

- **It's more reliable.** Eight minutes in the microwave will give you perfect beans 100% of the time - good luck achieving that on a stove!

Alright - I've said my piece. You can take it on board and have superior baked beans from now on, or ignore it and live a life of sub-par beans. It's your call.
