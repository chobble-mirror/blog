Today is a Monday, and my last day of working at [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com) was the Friday just gone. I now plan to work as a freelancer. I did this in my 20s, but I did it all wrong - I didn't charge enough to pay myself a proper wage, and I didn't have much of a mission statement. I was also nowhere near as experienced as I am now, nearly 15 years later. It will be different this time around, I hope.

I plan to start a [Community Interest Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_interest_company) which is a type of social enterprise company "for people wishing to establish businesses which trade with a social purpose". Specifically, I want to use my techy, web'y skills to:

- Teach local businesses how to take control of their online presence.
- Build websites and tooling using libre technologies.
- Open source the code I write and give and complete instructions.
- Never lock anyone in to using my services.
- Be very transparent about my costs and finances.
- Re-invest profits into local charities.
- Work at discounted or free rates for ethically-minded businesses.
- Trade services rather than money whenever possible.
